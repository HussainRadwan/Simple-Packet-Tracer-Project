# Packet Tracer Project

This project entails designing and implementing a computer network topology using Packet Tracer, a network simulation tool. The topology comprises routers, switches, servers, and PCs organized into different sub-networks such as a data center, company networks, a home network, and a core network.

### IP Subnetting and Assignment:
Each device in the topology, including routers and end devices, is assigned IP addresses.

### Building the Topology:
The topology described in Figure is constructed within Packet Tracer, with appropriate subnetting configurations applied to routers and interfaces configured according to the provided instructions.

### Configuring Interfaces:
Interfaces of all routers are configured according to the topology specifications.

### Configuring End Devices:
End devices in various networks (home, company, data center) receive static IP assignments based on the assigned network IPs.

### Configuring Servers:
Three servers (HTTP/WEB server, DNS server, and Email server) are configured. The DNS and WEB servers are configured with a domain name, and a custom website is created for the HTTP server. Usernames and passwords are set for email accounts.

#### The WEP server page:

### Applying Routing Protocol:
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol is implemented on all routers, with specific areas assigned to each network segment.

### Testing Connectivity and Services:
Connectivity between all PCs is tested using ping and tracert commands. Access to the custom website hosted on the HTTP server is tested from all PCs. Additionally, email communication between PCs is tested, and snapshots of results are recorded for documentation.
